    title: WebPutty and Respond.js
    layout: post

---

A couple of months ago, [Fog Creek][] came out with [WebPutty][], a
"simple CSS editing and hosting service."  It is a fantastic tool which hosts
CSS files for me.  This in itself is not that bspecial, but what makes this
service awesome is that it lets me write my styles in [SCSS][] and it also has
a pretty slick interface for letting me see style changes on the fly.  I was
loving it, but then I ran into a stumbling block, which I'll get to in a bit.

Respond.js
----------

I've been experimenting with [responsive web design][] for a little bit now.  To
aid me in accomplishing this with older deficient Internet Explorer browsers, I
turned to [Respond.js][].  Respond.js will parse all of a web pages CSS styles
and find the [media queries][] it supports and emulate them with [JavaScript][]
to the best of its abilities.  To be able to retrieve the external CSS files,
Respond.js performs an [Ajax][] request.  Since Ajax has a
[same origin policy][], Respond.js cannot access stylesheets that are stored
externally on a separate domain, such as [webputty.net][WebPutty].  Respond.js
does have a solution for this: a proxy HTML file that must be on the external
site hosting the CSS.  I asked the guys at Fog Creek to implement this, and they
have so kindly obliged.
