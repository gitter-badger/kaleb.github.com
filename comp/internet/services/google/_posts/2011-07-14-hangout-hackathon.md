    title: Google+ Hangout Hackathon
    subtitle: Google+ Hangouts Uses Google Wave and jQuery
---

Last night, I was invited to a [Google+ Hangout][1] to participate in a
[Chrome extension hackathon][2].  I was not able to participate much due to
bloat that I've allowed to accumulate in my [Ubuntu][] along with the slowness
of my DSL internet connection.  It is really too bad, because I felt that I
could have learned much from the other individuals involved.

The project that we were working on is a [chrome extension that allows users to
play a game of pong while using Hangouts][3].  This adds a whole new
dynamic to what users can do in Hangouts.

To be able to pull off creating this extension, we had to delve into the source
code of Hangouts.  While doing this, we noticed some interesting things.
[Mohamed Mansour][4] noticed a couple of interesting things.

Google+ Hangouts Uses Google Wave
---------------------------------

One of the tasks needed to get the extension to work is that we needed to find
a way to easily and programmatically access the list of all users currently in
the Hangout.  Mansour discovered a hidden `<iframe>` that contained much of its
logic and data.  

<div class="centered">
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XpQ8ldm8H5mZRFzsX1Nw_Q?feat=embedwebsite">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OIL3stpOehc/Th8XA5_cwhI/AAAAAAAADtU/2RSjslEQmpQ/s400/screenshot-20110714-121716.png" height="250" width="400" />
</a>
</div>

Deep inside this maze, Mansour discovered that Hangouts made some calls to
[Google Wave][5] services. This was pretty interesting considering the fact
that [Google wave was retired][6] almost 3 years ago. Well, not that interesting
in that they did state they stated that they will
<q cite="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html">
extend the technology for use in other Google projects.</q> 

Google+ Hangouts Uses jQuery
----------------------------

Another interesting Mansour discovered is that Hangouts uses [jQuery][7] throughout.
This seemed like an odd finding for a couple reasons.  The first strange thing about
this choice of JavaScript library, is that I have not seen its usage in any other
Google product.  The second oddity is that none of the JavaScript was not compiled
with [Google Closure][8].  Is Google getting real JavaScript web developer so work
on these new projects and shying away from the Java Google Web Toolkit programmers
from previous products?  I don't mean to sound harsh by saying that, but I think
that JavaScript needs a little more respect than the
<abbr title="Google Web Toolkit">GWT</abbr> project gives it.

All and all, for the brief time that I was participating in the hackathon, I was
enjoying myself immensely. I would love to do one again, but before I do, I need
to tune my desktop and switch to Comcast.
